Retired tasks remain valid dependency IDs. They describe completed reference/correctness work; the
performance and scale follow-ups stay active under PORT/FIT/INIT/BENCH/ABL tasks.

## Suggested order (from the 2026-07-03 repo review)

CORE-004/FIT-002/HIER-002/COMP-002/INIT-005/BENCH-002/ABL-003 fix confirmed bugs and
science-gating ambiguities. FIT-003 removed fit-loop metric overhead and added the optional fused
SSIM backend, and FIT-004 added the densification/relocation controls needed for the experiment.
Next run ABL-004 (the actual experiment, with evidence committed). After that, the 2026-07 SOTA
review suggests the most pragmatic improvement order:

1. FIT-005 exact/alternating color solve — completed 2026-07-06; keep default off, stage-search
   axis available as `color_solve=every10`.
2. FIT-006 frequency-violation densification — completed 2026-07-06; keep default off,
   stage-search refine axis available as `freq_violation`.
3. FIT-007 moment-preserving split — completed 2026-07-06; keep default off,
   stage-search refine axis available as `moment_preserving`.
4. FF-001 feed-forward teacher-student warm start, with FIT-008 adaptive count as the natural
   companion if fixed-N prediction underfits complex images.
5. COMP-004 for compression-aware fitting once RD baselines are stable.
6. PORT-002/PORT-003 if tiled CUDA remains strategically important after quality work.
7. GEN-003 after GEN-001 has a debuggable SDS baseline.
